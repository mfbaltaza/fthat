# FThat

This is a helpful tool for bad habit removal.

Have you ever found yourself mindlessly scrolling just out of habit? A new tab opens, and suddenly you are deep as fuck in Reddit, or whatever people do nowadays.

FThat cuts the cord. Visits 1-5 to a blocked site get auto-closed. After that, you get a blank screen asking if you're going to make us beg.

To disable it, you have to admit defeat by typing:  
*"I am extremely weak, and I need a break. Please let me fail"*

Get back to work.

No humans were harmed in the making of this chrome extension.
